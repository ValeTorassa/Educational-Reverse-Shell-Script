# Educational-Reverse-Shell-Script
This repository contains a simple reverse shell implementation intended for educational purposes and network security training. The code demonstrates how a reverse shell operates and can be used for penetration testing exercises.

Disclaimer: This code is provided for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this code for malicious activities is strictly prohibited. Always obtain proper authorization before using reverse shells in any environment. Use responsibly and ethically.

## Reverse Shell Implementations
The repository includes reverse shell implementations in three different programming languages at the moment: Python, C, and C#. Each implementation demonstrates how to create a reverse shell, which connects back to an attacker's machine and executes commands received from the attacker.

| Language   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Python** | Python is a high-level, interpreted language. The reverse shell in Python uses the `socket` library to create a network connection and the `subprocess` library to execute system commands.                                                         |
| **C**      | C is a low-level, compiled language. The reverse shell in C uses the Winsock2 library for network communication and the `system` function to execute commands.                                                                                      |
| **C#**     | C# is a high-level, compiled language that runs on the .NET framework. The reverse shell in C# uses the `Socket` class from the `System.Net.Sockets` namespace and the `Process` class from the `System.Diagnostics` namespace to execute commands. |
